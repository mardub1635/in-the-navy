| Original | New lyrics |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure | Where can you find power, be a superuser |
| Learn science technology? | Learn prompt and technology |
| Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true | Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true |           
| On the land or on the sea? |by command rather than gui? |
|    Where can you learn to fly, play in sports and skin dive | where can you make programs change or  move delete files |
| Study oceanography? | in just one letter or three? |
| Sign off for the big band or sit in the grandstand  |  enigmatic white dash, blincking on my black bash  |  | 
access root with a slash, escape with anti-slash |  | search the doc via "man" , shave like Richard stallman |
| When your team and others meet |  Why does it say "File missing"?  |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Yes, you can sail the seven seas |  path absolute or relative? |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Yes, you can put your mind at ease | be careful it's case sensitive! |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Come on now, people, make a stand |  come on now people use command |
| In the navy, in the navy | in the shell script |
| Can't you see we need a hand |  Stop putting space in filnames! |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Come on, protect the motherland | Or put quotes keep in the game! |
| In the navy  |  In the shell script |
| Come on and join your fellow man  |   But how to change directory? |
| In the navy  |  Just use CD |
| Come on people and make a stand  |  Oh right I type DIR or CD! |
| In the navy, in the navy, in the navy, oh |
| They want you, they want you  |  press the tab, press the tab |
| They want you as a new recruit  |  press the tab will autocomplete |
| If you like adventure, don't you wait to enter  |  count with wc don't forget the dash -c |
| The recruiting office fast  |  If you want to count letters |
| Don't you hesitate, there is no need to wait  |  But if I were you, 'would use -w |
| They're signing up new seamen fast  |  that count words and rhymes better! |
| Maybe you are too young to join up today  |  Forget click by the way, CTRL+E CTRL+A |
| But don't you worry 'bout a thing |  will be far more rescuing! |
| For I'm sure there will be always a good navy  |  And with your arrow key explore your history |
| Protecting the land and sea  |  CTRL+R search, you will see |
| In the navy  |  in the shell script |
| Yes, you can sail the seven seas  | " No such file or directory" |
| In the navy | In the shell script
| Yes, you can put your mind at ease |  "Operation is not permited!" |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Come on people, fall an' make a stand  | Are you sure it's the right command? |
| In the navy, in the navy | in the shell script, in the shell script |
| Can't you see we need a hand  |  Don't put space in your filenames |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Come on, protect the motherland | or put slash behind the space |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Come on and join your fellow man |  come on now people use command |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Come on people and make a stand |   But how to move directory? |
| In the navy, in the navy, in the navy, in the navy | in the shell script, in the shell script, in the shell script |
| They want you, they want you  |  press the tab, press the tab |
| They want you as a new recruit  |  press the tab will autocomplete |
| Who me? | *mv?* |
| They want you, they want you |  press the tab, press the tab |
| They want you as a new recruit |  press the tab will autocomplete |
| But, but, but, I'm afraid of water | *but, but, but, I can't remove the folder!* |
| Hey, hey look man  | *I read the "man"* |
| I get seasick even watchin' it on TV | *But rm -d says it's not empty* |
| They want you, they want you in the navy | press the tab in the shell script |
| Oh my goodness | *Oh check ls* |
| They want you  | *yer not empty* |
| What am I gonna do in a submarine? | *What do you mean recursive?* |
| They want you | press the tab |
| They want you, they want you in the navy | 
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Yes, you can sail the seven seas | path absolute or relative ? |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Yes, you can put your mind at ease | be careful it's case sensitive |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Come on people, fall in make a stand | Are you sure it's the right command? |
| In the navy, in the navy | in the shell script, in the shell script |
| Can't you see we need a hand  |  Don't put space in your filenames |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Come on, protect the motherland |  or put quotes at the right place |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Come on and join your fellow man | come on now people use command |
| In the navy | in the shell script |
| Come on people and make a stand | Don't put space in your filenames |
