On the music of In the navy by the village people`
- Original lyrics Proposed new lyrics
- In the shell script
- yes you hack on every screens
- Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure / Where can you find find power, be a superuser
- Learn science technology?/ Learn shell and technology
- Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true
- On the land or on the sea?/by command rather than gui
- Where can you learn to fly, play in sports and skin dive/where can you make programs, locate folder, f//read source file change move delete
- Study oceanography?/forget to use cd!
- Sign off for the big band or sit in the grandstand/search the doc via "man" , shave like Richard stallman
- When your team and others meet
- In the navy/in the shell script
- Yes, you can sail the seven seas/ path absolute or relative?//yes you can hack everyones'screens
- In the navy/in the shell script
- Yes, you can put your mind at ease/be careful it's case sensitive!
- In the navy/in the shell script
- Come on now, people, make a stand/ come on now people  command
- In the navy, in the navy
- Can't you see we need a hand/
- In the navy
- Come on, protect the motherland
- In the navy
- Come on and join your fellow man
- In the navy
- Come on people and make a stand
- In the navy, in the navy, in the navy, oh
- They want you, they want you
- They want you as a new recruit
- If you like adventure, don't you wait to enter
- The recruiting office fast
- Don't you hesitate, there is no need to wait
- They're signing up new seamen fast
- Maybe you are too young to join up today
- But don't you worry 'bout a thing
- For I'm sure there will be always a good navy
- Protecting the land and sea
- In the navy
- Yes, you can sail the seven seas
- In the navy
- Yes, you can put your mind at ease
- In the navy
- Come on people, fall an' make a stand
- In the navy, in the navy
- Can't you see we need a hand
- In the navy
- Come on, protect the motherland
- In the navy
- Come on and join your fellow man
- In the navy
- Come on people and make a stand
- In the navy, in the navy, in the navy, in the navy
- They want you, they want you
- They want you as a new recruit
- Who me?
- They want you, they want you
- They want you as a new recruit
- But, but, but, I'm afraid of water
- Hey, hey look man
- I get seasick even watchin' it on TV
- They want you, they want you in the navy
- Oh my goodness
- They want you
- What am I gonna do in a submarine?
- They want you
- They want you, they want you in the navy
- In the navy
- Yes, you can sail the seven seas
- In the navy
- Yes, you can put your mind at ease
- In the navy
- Come on people, fall in make a stand
- In the navy, in the navy
- Can't you see we need a hand
- In the navy
- Come on, protect the motherland
- In the navy
- Come on and join your fellow man
- In the navy
- Come on people and make a stand
