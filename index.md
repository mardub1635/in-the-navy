## In the shell script

## Original lyrics / New lyrics // optional other lyrics

- Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure/Where can you find power, be a superuser
- Learn science technology?/ Learn prompt and technology
- Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true
- On the land or on the sea?/by command rather than gui?
- Where can you learn to fly, play in sports and skin dive/where can you make programs change or  move delete files
- Study oceanography?/in just one letter or three?
- Sign off for the big band or sit in the grandstand / enigmatic white dash, blincking on this black bash //
access root with a slash, escape with anti-slash//search the doc via "man" , shave like Richard stallman
- When your team and others meet/ Why my shell says "File missing"? //When others keep double click?
- In the navy/in the shell script
- Yes, you can sail the seven seas/ path absolute or relative?//yes you can hack everyones'screens
- In the navy/in the shell script
- Yes, you can put your mind at ease/be careful it's case sensitive!
- In the navy/in the shell script
- Come on now, people, make a stand/ come on now people use command
- In the navy, in the navy/in the shell script, in the shell script
- Can't you see we need a hand/ Don't put space in your filenames
- In the navy/in the shell script
- Come on, protect the motherland/ or put quotes in the right place!
- In the navy / 
- Come on and join your fellow man /  But how to change directory?
- In the navy / Just use CD
- Come on people and make a stand / Oh right I type DIR or CD!
- In the navy, in the navy, in the navy, oh
- They want you, they want you / press the tab, press the tab
- They want you as a new recruit / press the tab will autocomplete
- If you like adventure, don't you wait to enter / count with wc don't forget the dash -c
- The recruiting office fast / That will count your characters
- Don't you hesitate, there is no need to wait / But if I were you, I'd add dash -w
- They're signing up new seamen fast / and count both words and letters
- Maybe you are too young to join up today / Forget click by the way, CTRL+E CTRL+A
- But don't you worry 'bout a thing/ will be far more rescuing!
- For I'm sure there will be always a good navy / And with your arrow key explore your history
- Protecting the land and sea / CTRL+R search, you will see
- In the navy / in the shell script
- Yes, you can sail the seven seas /" No such file or directory"
- In the navy
- Yes, you can put your mind at ease/ "Operation is not permited!"
- In the navy
- Come on people, fall an' make a stand / come on now people use command
- In the navy, in the navy
- Can't you see we need a hand / 
- In the navy
- Come on, protect the motherland
- In the navy
- Come on and join your fellow man
- In the navy
- Come on people and make a stand
- In the navy, in the navy, in the navy, in the navy
- They want you, they want you
- They want you as a new recruit
- Who me?
- They want you, they want you
- They want you as a new recruit
- But, but, but, I'm afraid of water
- Hey, hey look man
- I get seasick even watchin' it on TV
- They want you, they want you in the navy
- Oh my goodness
- They want you 
- What am I gonna do in a submarine?
- They want you
- They want you, they want you in the navy
- In the navy
- Yes, you can sail the seven seas
- In the navy
- Yes, you can put your mind at ease
- In the navy
- Come on people, fall in make a stand
- In the navy, in the navy
- Can't you see we need a hand
- In the navy
- Come on, protect the motherland
- In the navy
- Come on and join your fellow man
- In the navy
- Come on people and make a stand
