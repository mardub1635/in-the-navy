# Music creation
This repo parodies the music "In the navy" for terminal learners. Come and join the mother shell!

# Links
The result is published on a gitlab page https://mardub.gitlab.io/song/ that is automatically generated based on the file "index.md" using gitlab CI/CD.

The project itself is hosted both on [github](https://github.com/mardub1635/in-the-navy) and [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mardub/song/-/blob/main/index.md) you can fork from any of these and modify and make a PR.
# Issues
Since the project is both on github and gitlab I store the issues in this Readme. Feel free to create issue you want to solve in the format and platform you prefer.
- [ ] Sing! This project needs a singer. I cannot sing myself. If you always dreamed of using your voice to serve a noble cause it is your opportunity!

- [ ] Karaoke: create a karaoke like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrHdIU4KJL0)

- [ ] Lyrics, the lyrics work as it is but can always be improved. If you want to do so respect the following trade off: the lyrics must be playful, respect the joyful spirit of the original, rhyme properly, and teach something true about terminal command (powershell or unix). This music is intended for an audience of absolute terminal beginners.

- [ ] Parody movie: Once the music is sang creating a video that would display what the lyrics mean (for instance screenshots of the error messages evoked in the song etc.)
