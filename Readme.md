This repo parodies the music "In the navy" for terminal learners. Come and join the mother shell!

# Links
The result is published on a gitlab page https://mardub.gitlab.io/song/ that is automatically generated based on the file "index.md" using gitlab CI/CD.

The project itself is hosted both on [github](https://github.com/mardub1635/in-the-navy) and [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mardub/song/-/blob/main/index.md) you can fork from any of these and modify and make a PR.
# Issues
Since the project is both on github and gitlab I store the issues in this Readme. But feel free to create the issue you want to solve in any of those platforms.
