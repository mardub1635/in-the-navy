# Music creation
This repo parodies the music "In the navy" for terminal learners. Come and join the mother shell!

# Links
The result is published on a gitlab page https://mardub.gitlab.io/song/ .

The project itself is hosted both on [github](https://github.com/mardub1635/in-the-navy) and [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mardub/song/-/blob/main/index.md) you can fork from any of these.
# Issues
Since the project is both on github and gitlab I store the issues in this Readme. Feel free to create issue you want to solve in the format and platform you prefer.
- [ ] *Sing!* This project needs a singer. I cannot sing myself. If you always dreamed of using your voice to serve a noble cause it is your opportunity!

- [ ] *Promote*, for this project to develop I need a good promoter. You can also credited for that.


- [ ] Karaoke: create a karaoke like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrHdIU4KJL0)

- [ ] Parody movie: Once the music is sang creating a video that would display what the lyrics mean (for instance screenshots of the error messages evoked in the song etc.)

- [X] Lyrics, the lyrics work as it is but can always be improved. If you want to do so respect the following trade off: the lyrics must be playful, respect the joyful spirit of the original, rhyme properly, and teach something true about terminal command (powershell or unix). This music is intended for an audience of absolute terminal beginners.
